# Creating and updating pages

Creating simple pages is straightforward, but mastering all the possibilities may take time. I strongly recommend [taking a look at the homepage](/desk/page;HOME_ID_HERE ':ignore') to learn how it's made and get a sense for the structure of a complex page.

The video below guides you through building a simple text-only page.

<!-- SUGGESTION: add a video for editors going through the creation of a page from scratch -->

## Previewing pages as you build them

For previewing, you'll have to be logged into the CMS from your current device/browser. You can use the views/tabs in documents to learn how the page will look live:

- Desktop Preview: how it'll look in large screens. If you want to see the full page in your browser, click on the 3 dots menu at the top right of the document and click on "Open Preview".
- Mobile Preview: how it'll look in a myriad of devices. Please note that it's an imperfect representation, opening the full-page preview in your phone is advised if you want to see it clearer (keep in mind you'll have to log into the CMS first). Also, you may want to zoom your screen out to see the whole device.
- Social & SEO: an approximation of how the page will look in Google, Twitter, LinkedIn & Facebook.

!> Please note that if you start previewing a published document with "Open Preview" and then start editing it, you'll need to re-open the preview for it to come into effect as the draft and the published versions are two different documents in the database.

If you have a screen large enough, you can split panes to see the page form on the left and previews on the right by clicking on the top-right "columns" icon in a page document:

## Translating pages

When editing a page, click on the "Translations" view to list every translation to it. From there, click on the desired language to edit that version. You can see which translation you're currently editing via the title of the document ("My Internal Title (LANG)") or via the green badge at the footer of the document (next to the "Changes {x}h ago" box):

It's highly recommended that you finish the main version of the page before moving on to its translations. In doing so, we'll duplicate the document into another language to keep the structure of the page, making it easier to translate portion by portion without having to open the English version at all times.

?> Even if you master both languages, some times it's faster to use [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) to do the heavy lift and just review the rough edges.

## Sharing newly-created pages

Once you publish the page, it'll be available under the URL shown in the relative address, as shown below:

![Screenshot of the slug field](/page-slug-field.png)

In the example above, the final URL would be: https://variable.co/terms-and-conditions

Once you open the URL and ensure all is as expected, you can start sharing it across the internet!
