# Starting out with the CMS

## The basics

In the "Content" menu on your left you'll find pages, settings and pricing structures. Editing documents is as simple as selecting them, changing fields and hitting publish.

For the non-english versions of documents, refer to the "Translations" tab in each document.

For working with pages, refer to the "Creating pages" guide on the left.

Some helpful links:

<!-- These :ignore are to prevent Docsify from transforming URLs to open in docs and instead open the URL in the studio -->

- [All pages](/desk/page ':ignore')
- [Create a new page](/intent/create/template=page;type=page/ ':ignore')
- [Edit settings](/desk/settings ':ignore')

## How updates work

See the [pages guide](/pages) for information on how to create, update and delete content in the website.
