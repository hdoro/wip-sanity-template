# Working with images

**General guidelines for all occurrences**:

- Keep diversity in mind when choosing images with people in them
- Try to keep a _consistent vibe_ or feel to the images.
- Upload images with the _highest quality possible_ - the code will adapt them automatically.
- Submit it with a _descriptive file name_ to make it easier to find it in the media library later.
- If you intend to use it again in another part of the website, take some time to properly _tag the image in the media library_.
- If the image is a simple icon or logo, it's better to upload it as a vector as they're smaller in size and better in quality.

**Guidelines specific to social sharing images:**

- Upload it in dimensions 1200x628px or with similar aspect ratio
- Avoid as much text in it as possible, and if necessary keep it large
  - remember that users will be seeing it as a small thumbnail when browsing Twitter/Facebook/Instagram on mobile, so it's hard to read these
