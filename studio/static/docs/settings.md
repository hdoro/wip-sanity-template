# Settings, scripts & navigation

In the settings document you can change:

- What are the home and the 404 / not found pages
- Which links should go in the header and footer
- What are the labels that the newsletter form should display
- Global scripts to be added to all pages
- The default sharing image for social media
- Links of your brand's social accounts

?> You can use the 404 / not found page to add relevant content to lost visitors for a chance to convert them to customers or newsletter subscribers.

## Adding custom scripts

You can add scripts for custom functionality such as analytics, chat widgets and more. To do that, you can either go to Settings and enable them to all pages or go to the individual page you'd like to edit and add to its "Custom code for this page" field.

Scripts can come at 3 different locations in the HTML of the page, usually the tools you're copying from tell you where they should go.

!> Beware of what you're adding to the site. Some scripts will make the website unbearably slow, others will make it insecure or even break the user experience. Make sure you trust its source and understand what are the consequences of it being there.

When in doubt about custom scripts, ask a developer about it ;)

## Navigation

Like all other links in the site, header and footer navigation can either point to an absolute URL / internal section, or to another page in the website.

If you want to test it out before it going live, do the change, publish the settings document and then head to any page to see the new navigation in the preview. If all is good, then go ahead and deploy the site.
